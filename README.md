Presentation:

My name is Jurijus Pacalovas.

It can compress random files. Program compress not any files sometimes the file make it bigger. I had read literature about compressions like RLE, Huffman, PI, and API. I started to think about compression further on their own and operated by the wayside 2013 year. RLE Algorithm: could be deleting the same information or find information. Huffman Algorithm: it is deleting long makes long smaller, e.g. Huffman 0, 10, 11... PI Algorithm: it is written information were find and the end. API compression algorithm: it takes from 1 to 348 variations. I check numbers what absent? compress I use Algorithm count PI. I count PI by long. I use calculus with check variation absent for the block. I use calculation numbers.

When compress you need enter options for compress.

Deep 1-27.

Bye, Bye.
